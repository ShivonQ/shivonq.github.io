This Wiki Page is created by Malcolm Leehan for housing the massive amount of information on my Dungeons and Dragons world; Archaevas
A few features that will be in it are as follows;

*Custom Google Map, complete with marked locations for major cities
    (*)Google Maps hover info
    (*)Google Maps zoom to closer maps, for select locations.  I will list them eventually in the "Cities" page
    (*)Mini Map for local view

*Interactive Calendar
    (*)Hard Coded Days/Months, Each day will be associated to a "day" json object that stores relevant data
    (*)JS enabled calendar that displays more info in little hover window, links to places/people
    (*)JS enabled way of adding information to a days occurrences
    (*)JS Weather & Temperature maker (Maybe almanac data)

*Lots of good looking pages with global, local and bootstrap css elements.

*STRETCH GOALS*
    (*)User Accounts: Real user accounts to show certain info to certain accounts.

Map Page:
   Almost works.
   Google API does not allow the images to be on a local device for security reasons.
   So I have to figure out a solution there for that.
   Once its working then it is just a matter of Arrangement and prettifying it.

Calendar Page:
  Hard Coded lunar cycle and days and months.
  Need to create JS to dynamicly bring up info box for a day on a hovering mouse, click a day and box stays til closed.

 Main Page:
   Figuring out how to change color of bootstrap navbar, being uncooperative.
   Adding some links to it to the other two pages.
   Need to figure out how to extend the navbar, or just copy it. (Javascript constructor)
